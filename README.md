Different MYSQL practise exercises from Egg.live Java Backend Program

Hi guys I have to admit I haven't thought much
about storing what I do up here.
This is my first try, hopefuly this will work
great.

Basically I have included every single MYSQL
excercise we've had in the program, I will be
updating it as there are some not solved.

To use is you need to have the data bases we've
worked with...
Maybe I later will include those.

Ok thank you for reading, happy coding.
